== DESCRIPTION:

Adds a new assertion to minitest for checking the contents of a collection,
ignoring element order.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* The actual and expected collections must be Enumerable.
* Uses Hash#== for determining collection equivalence; as such, element
  equality does not behave the same as with +assert_equal+.

== SYNOPSIS:

  assert_equal_unordered %w[a a b c], %w[a b c a] # pass
  assert_equal_unordered %w[a b b c], %w[a a b c] # fail

  [1, 2, 3].must_equal_unordered [3, 1, 2] # pass
  [1, 2, 3].must_equal_unordered [1, 2, 2] # fail

=== EXAMPLE:

  require "minitest/autorun"
  require "minitest/unordered"

  class ExampleTest < MiniTest::Unit::TestCase
    EXPECTED_DEPS = [
      ["hoe",  "~> 2.13.1"],
      ["rdoc", "= 3.9"],
      ["rdoc", "= 3.8"],
      ["hoe",  "~> 2.13.3"],
      ["hoe",  "~> 2.13.2"],
      ["hoe",  "~> 2.13.0"],
      ["rdoc", "= 3.12"]
    ]

    def setup
      @actual_deps = [
        ["rdoc", "= 3.9"],
        ["hoe",  "~> 2.13.2"],
        ["hoe",  "~> 2.13.3"],
        ["rdoc", "= 3.8"],
        ["hoe",  "~> 2.13.1"],
        ["hoe",  "~> 2.13.0"],
        ["rdoc", "= 3.12"]
      ]
    end

    def test_expected_deps
      assert_equal_unordered @actual_deps, EXPECTED_DEPS
    end
  end
